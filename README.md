### Setup
For the best user experience, Quarters Unity SDK utilises domain association to link users back to the app after purchasing and authorisation. Quarters SDK manages browser to app linking automatically. To set up linking please follow the steps for the chosen platform

#### iOS
1. Open [your PoQ APPS](https://www.poq.gg/apps)
2. Find your app and select iOS under the Auto Manage option
3. Enter any valid string as your PoQ app's unique identifier if empty
4. Enter Apple Team ID. It can be pulled from [Apple 
account](https://developer.apple.com/account/#!/membership/)
5. Enter your app bundle id. Example com.mycompany.mygame
6. Press Submit
7. Copy your PoQ app's unique identifier to the Quarters Init component APP_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER field in Unity and press Save

#### Android
1. Open [your PoQ APPS](https://www.poq.gg/apps)
2. Find your app and select iOS under the Auto Manage option
3. Enter any valid string as your PoQ app's unique identifier if empty
4. Enter your app package name. Example com.mycompany.mygame
5. You need to get SHA-256 certificate fingerprint, to do that just run the following command on your terminal (note the keytool comes with the Java SDK or included with Unity Android OpenJDK ex. `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2021.3.2f1\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\AndroidPlayer\OpenJDK\jre\bin` in case of Unity 2021.3.2f1 editor)

```
keytool -list -v -keystore mystorekeystore.keystore
```
Running this command should yield something similar to the following image:

6. Press Submit

## Troubleshooting

‚ö†Ô∏è Important notes: ‚ö†Ô∏è

Currently you cannot make a transfer between your app and your developer account. To test your app, you need to create a secondary test account on https://www.poq.gg/. For more information about transfers you can [check our API documentation](https://github.com/weiks/poq-docs/blob/main/docs/oauth-api.md#post-apiv1transactions).

### Pay or receive Quarters throws *Transaction Error*
When you try to Pay or receive Quarters you get *Transaction Error: Debit and Cretit address cannot be the same. You cannot test your app when you are logged into your developer account* to fix it:
1. Sign Out.
2. Sign In with a registered user that is has not developer rights. 

### Pay or receive Quarters throws *Missing refresh token*
When you try to Pay or receive Quarters you get *Missing refresh token* to fix it:
1. Sign Out.
2. Sign In again with the same account.

### Pay throws *Your app must be verified to transfer Quarters from users*
When you try to Pay or receive Quarters you get *Your app must be verified to transfer Quarters from users* to fix it:
1. Verify your app [contacting us](#before-you-start).

### Pressing `Authorize` in Android mobile doesn't redirect to the app.
When you `Sign In` with the sample app you are not redirected to the app after pressing `Authorize` button in your browser.
Some mobile internet browsers (like Samsung default internet explorer) don't redirect to the app inmediatly. In case you want to be redirected inmediatly to the app change your default internet mobile browser:
1. On your Android phone, tap `Settings`.
2. Then tap `Apps & Notifications` (or in old Android versions `App Management`) and finally `Default Apps`
3. There on the option `Browser App` you will be able to change your default mobile browser

### Making a transaction (pay or receive) shows `Transaction error: Debit and credit address cannot be the same.` 
When you create an app with your developer account supposse `X@domain.com` you login to the integration app using that developer account if you try to make a transaction (as long as it's pay or receive) you will get this message error:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3865131/185242146-fecfca01-ffcb-43bb-80e3-8353d867a90b.png)

To fix it: 
1. Log out from the integration app.
2. Login to the integration app with a different account than the one you used to create the app (`X@domain.com`).
